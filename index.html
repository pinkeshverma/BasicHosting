                    <h3>Do's</h3>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            
                            <li>
                                ​Wash your hands frequently (several times a day) for at least 20 seconds with soap and water. If you are in a situation where you can't avail soap and water, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure to clean your hand before eating or cooking, after sneezing or coughing, after touching a metal surface, after touching a sick person and after using the toilet.</li>
                                <li>Keep a check on the symptoms of coronavirus, which can range from common cough and fever to shortness of breath.</li>
                                <li>Wear a face mask if you already are suffering from the common symptoms of the virus.</li>
                                <li>Stay extra cautious at public places and if possible, avoid crowds and frequenting such places. Moreover, if you are over 60 years old or have a low risk tolerance, it is better to stay at home. The studies have shown that people with low risk tolerance and seniors are more likely to get prone to COVID-19. Also, people with pre-existing conditions such as heart problems, diabetes and respiratory diseases also fall under the category high-risk group.</li>
                                <li>Delay or cancel your trips to the affected countries. Many airlines around the world have canceled their flights to China. People falling under high-risk groups must avoid traveling to countries severely infected.</li>
                                <li>Get yourself and your family covered under the health insurance policy</li>
                                <li>If you are feeling sick, contact your doctor to know the procedure about what to do, instead of directly visiting the clinic, to avoid transmitting the infection to others.  </li>
                                
                            </ul>

                            <li>Don't go outside of the home if you are not feeling well. If you are already traveling and get sick on the flight or cruise, inform the crew members immediately. Contact your doctor as soon as you get home.</li>
                            <li>Don't panic, according to public health officials the risk of coronavirus is still not that high. Prepare yourself and take proper precautions to save yourself from the attack. Not having or renewing your health insurance can be a big mistake.

                <h2>#FAQs- Frequently asked questions</h2>
                <p>
                    Q: How does COVID-19 spread?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, typically within 1 metre (short-range). A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q: What is the official name of the coronavirus disease?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: ICTV announced “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)” as the name of the new virus on 11 February 2020.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q: Do smokers get more severe symptoms of COVID-19 if infected?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: Smoking any kind of tobacco reduces lung capacity and increases the risk of many respiratory infections and can increase the severity of respiratory diseases. COVID-19 is an infectious disease that primarily attacks the lungs. Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other respiratory diseases. Available research suggests that smokers are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 outcomes and death.

A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.
